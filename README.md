# UNP_Project_BI_with_Power_BI_HR
Completed this project as a part of my BI with Power BI Internship with United Network of Professionals(UNP)

This project delves into employee attrition, using Power BI to analyse extensive datasets and uncover the reasons behind them. Through interactive visualizations, we explore factors like age, experience level, and work performance. 
This equips decision-makers with data-driven insights to develop strategies that minimize employee turnover and foster a positive work environment. By combining strong research and professional expertise, "Exploring Attrition Trends" offers a valuable resource for organizations seeking to optimize their workforce retention strategies and enhance overall performance.
